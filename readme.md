# Swimmy-Crab

The repository for a game built in Rust with the [Bevy Engine](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy): "Swimmy Crab!"  
It's effectively Flappy Bird but with a charismatic crustacean mascot instead: Bailey the Blue Crab (Portunus pelagicus)! Help Bailey swim through the water and avoid obstacles!
